## Train Robust Deep Learning Network with Jacobian Regularization
Neural networks can be susceptible to a phenomenon known as adversarial examples , where very small changes to an input can cause it to be misclassified. 
These changes are often imperceptible to humans. Second-order methods such as Jacobian regularization have been shown to help increase the robustness of networks
against adversaries . 

$ This project shows how to:
 1. Train a robust image classification network using a Jacobian regularization scheme.
 2. Compare its predictions to a network trained without Jacobian regularization.
